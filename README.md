# Dynamic Arrays

## Vectors vs Pointers

I coded 2 exact same programs with only difference that in the first one I used pointers to allocate memory (wiht keywors "new") and create 
dynamic arrays while in the second one I used vectors (from std::vector) as dynamic arrays. With this "experiment" I wanted to enhance my C++
skills and to investigate the differencies of the two programs.

## What I Learned
- It's better to understand the basics of memory and pointers first and the you can procced to vectors.
- Vectors are a far superior and faster tool to use for dynamic arrays but that doesn't mean you have to underestimate the usage of pointers.
- As a first year computer engineer student this project is great practice and a way to really comprehend pointers and vectors and to understand memory allocation and dynamic arrays.
